Python Identifiers
An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. It helps to differentiate one entity from another.

Rules for writing identifiers
Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore _. Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is a valid name.
Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
global = 1
Output
  File "<interactive input>", line 1
    global = 1
           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier.
a@ = 0

Output
  File "<interactive input>", line 1
    a@ = 0
     ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
